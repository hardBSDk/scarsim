## Inspiration

- [RandomNation](https://rosenburgergames.com/randomnation/)
- [Enchanted Fortress](https://github.com/subchannel13/EnchantedFortress)
- [Rival Regions](https://rivalregions.com/)
- [Dwarf Fortress](http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/)

## Motivation

I consider the available economy management games too complex or boring.

## Why Godot?

The Godot engine allows you to save a lot of time in development because of the node system, where the relationship between the game components is very easily and fast to implement things.

Also because of GDScript, the Godot scripting language allows you to write less code to implement things.
